            <h3>Many of the terms for coffee drinks come to us from Italian, where they are terms of utility. <br>Espresso comes from the Italian word that means "pressed-out," which explains how the <br>coffee drink is made; macchiato is short for "caffe macchiato," which means "coffee with a <br>spot (of milk)." But cappuccino bucks the trend: it comes from an Italian word that refers not <br>to coffee, but to friars.
