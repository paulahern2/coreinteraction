    <h2>معجون (mahjoun)</h2>
    <div id="recipe">
      <p>This Moroccan desert treat has been a trademark dish of the nomadic Berber for over 1000 years.<br>
        Originally infused with psychoactive ingredients, mahjoun is "one of the oldest known pot foods, a heady jam, thick with dried fruits, chopped nuts and prized spices. Favored by Moroccans, denizens of the Middle East and other Mediterranean peoples, this potent concoction is known colloquially as mahjoun, mahjoum or mazhoum."
