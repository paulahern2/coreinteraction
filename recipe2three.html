    <div id="recipe">


      <p>1. In a food processor, add the nuts individually and gently grind into small pieces. Reserve ¼ cup ground pistachios for coating jam balls and set aside.<br><br>
2. Using kitchen shears or a paring knife, remove any stems from figs. Check dates carefully, removing any pits or hulls. Finely dice and set aside.<br><br>
3. Chop dates and figs fairly fine.<br><br>
4. Remove butter mixture from oven and place in a medium saucepan on the stove over low heat.<br><br>
5. Add flour and whisk to blend well. Continue cooking on a low simmer until foaming (4 to 5 minutes), stirring constantly just until roux is lightly browned, being cautious not to burn butter. Remove from heat and add salt. Stir to blend. Set aside until cool. <br><br>
6. Mix and knead all ingredients.<br><br>
7. Add a little rose or orange water to increase stickiness if it's too dry.<br><br>
9. Roll into balls about the size of a walnut. Coat with ground pistachios.<br><br>
